Many works such as the accident analysis of the industry process, many involved datas must be demonstrated in one figure with Matlab, you maybe had the same trouble that I had. For example,the limit of the data A is between-1000 and 1000,but the other data’s limit maybe is an very narrow band between -1 and 1，this would result in a circumstance showed in the fig-1:the plotted lines of Data1, data2 and data 4 locate in a very narrow area and you couldn’t view data details conveniently, But if useing MultiYcontrol instead to produce a graphic such as fig-2, you can watch and mark these datas casually. That is to say, the MultiYcontrol can divide datas into some groups and draw every group in individual area and surpporting to tip data correctly. Another virtue of this control is allowing you to use duration type data as the x coordinate, the x-tick label and data tips all will be displayed with time format(before preceding to read this document, you could have a glimpse at fig_7).
